| Box Plot should be made more clear | Will add a better title and annotation for Box Plot (GPA) |
|       Need to revamp high school section                                   |        Will shorten or add annotations to High School section for quick readability                                                                       |
|                      Presentation felt too long                 |        Since I am presenting a lot of data, I will keep each section short and to the point, especially while presenting                                 
                                                                 

Overall, my presentation had a positive reception. The topic was well liked and was the data was very relevant. I just need be careful about not diving too much into detail for any particular section while presenting.
