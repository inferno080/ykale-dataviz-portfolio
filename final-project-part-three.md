# The Final Data Story
[Public Article Link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/a-guide-to-thriving-in-the-2025-job-market/index.html)

My story touches on a topic that every student has on the top of their mind. We all know that the current job market is ... bad. This presentation aims to highlight the differences between students that bagged a job offer after graduation and students that remained unplaced. By making these statistical comparisons, we can identify patterns that placed students adhere to, which might help all students achieve success. I list a few action items at the end that make all this information easily digestable.

# Changes made since Part II
1. Changed the title of title of Box plot to make it more lively and convey what the data is trying to tell
2. Made changes in font sizes, according to feedback
3. Shortended my picth, to adhere to the 1 minute limit.


## The audience
The audience includes undergraduate as well as graduate students that want to enter the job market. 

## Final design decisions
1. I did not remove the high school section, as suggested by a user during my user research; as I felt it would still be relevant for ungergraduate students.
2. I checked all my graphs on the colorblind checker to make sure the presentation was inclusive of people with visual impariments.
3. Used red color to highlight action items and important insights
4. Added a summary of all action items at the end, to reenforce the important points. 

## References
  Note:  I recieved feedback from the TA, stating that a few references seemed missing for the numbers I have stated. However, I have cited all references I used in my shorthand presentation. All statistical calculations are my own and I haven't refereced to any external resource for them. 

## AI acknowledgements
Did not use AI for this assignment.

# Final thoughts
I recieved the TA feedback for Part II a tad bit too late, so I didn't get time to incorporate all the changes. If I had more time, I would focus on reframing the first few paragraphs as mentioned in my feedback for Part II.
